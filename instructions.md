For the assignment, could you:

Develop a small React application for contact management:

- Parse the included JSON list of contacts - names should be parsed as human readable "First Last" with extra characters removed, phone numbers should be consistently formatted.
- Display the list in a table view that is sortable by the end user, with columns for name, email, and phone number.
- Allow the end user to create, update, and delete contacts within the application. (Don't worry about persisting these actions to a server or anything like that, purely focus on the client side)

We know your time is valuable, and we definitely don't expect a large, production-worthy project. The intent is to evaluate your technical implementation and thought process in a scenario closely matching day to day work.

This assignment is our primary technical evaluation during the interview process. At the in-office interview stage we will discuss the sample and how you would go about expanding it (we don't do whiteboarding). You can store this on Github, Codepen, or send it over as a zip file - whatever you're most comfortable with. We recommend zero-configuration tools (such as create-react-app), we definitely don't want you to spend a bunch of extra time dealing with configuration and pipeline.
